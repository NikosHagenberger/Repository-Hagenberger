  <h1>Ice Hockey</h1>
  Ice hockey is a team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. The sport is known to be fast-paced and physical, with teams usually fielding six players at a time: one goaltender, and five players who skate the span of ice trying to control the puck and score goals against the opposing team.
  <br>Ice hockey is most popular in Canada, central and eastern Europe, the Nordic countries, Russia, and the United States. Ice hockey is the official national winter sport of Canada.  North America's National Hockey League (NHL) is the highest level for men's ice hockey and the strongest professional ice hockey league in the world.

  <h2>Game</h2>
  <p>
    Hockey is an off-side game, meaning that forward passes are allowed, unlike in rugby. Before the 1930s, hockey was an on-side game, meaning that only backward passes were allowed. Those rules favoured individual stick-handling as a key means of driving the puck forward. With the arrival of offside rules, the forward pass transformed hockey into a true team sport.
  </p>

  <h3>Periods and overtime</h3>
  <p>
    A professional game consists of three periods of twenty minutes, the clock running only when the puck is in play. The teams change ends after each period of play, including overtime. Recreational leagues and children's leagues often play shorter games, generally with three shorter periods of play. Various procedures are used if a tie occurs.
    Up until the 1999–2000 season regular season NHL games were settled with a single five-minute sudden death period, with both teams awarded one point in the standings in the event of a tie. With a goal, the winning team would be awarded two points and the losing team none.
    From the 1999–2000 until the 2003–04 seasons, the National Hockey League decided ties by playing a single five-minute sudden death overtime period with each team having four skaters per side (plus the goalie). In the event of a tie, each team would still receive one point in the standings but in the event of a victory the winning team would be awarded two points in the standings and the losing team one point.
    The idea was to discourage teams from playing for a tie, since previously some teams might have preferred a tie and 1 point to risking a loss and zero points. Since the 2015–16 season, the single five-minute sudden death overtime session involves three skaters on each side.

  <h3>Penalties</h3>

  <p>
    In ice hockey, infractions of the rules lead to play stoppages whereby the play is restarted at a face off. Some violations result in the imposition of a penalty to a player or team. In the simplest case, the offending player is sent to the penalty box and their team has to play with one less player on the ice for a designated amount of time. Minor penalties last for two minutes, major penalties last for five minutes.
    The team that has been given a penalty is said to be playing short-handed while the opposing team is on a power play.
    <br> A penalty shot is awarded to a player when the illegal actions of another player stop a clear scoring opportunity. A penalty shot allows the obstructed player to put the puck on the center red-line and attempt to score on the goalie with no other players on the ice, to compensate for the earlier missed scoring opportunity.

  <h3>Equipment</h3>
  <p>
    Since men's ice hockey is a full contact sport, body checks are allowed so injuries are a common occurrence. Protective equipment is mandatory and is enforced in all competitive situations. This includes a helmet with either a visor or a full face mask, shoulder pads, elbow pads, mouth guard, protective gloves, heavily padded shorts or a girdle, athletic cup, shin pads, skates, and a neck protector.
    <br>Goaltenders use different equipment. With hockey pucks approaching them at speeds of up to 160 km/h they must wear equipment with more protection. Goaltenders wear specialized goalie skates (these skates are built more for movement side to side rather than forwards and backwards), large leg pads, blocking glove, catching glove, a chest protector, a goalie mask, and a large jersey.
    <br>The hockey stick consists of a long, relatively wide, and slightly curved flat blade, attached to a shaft. The curve itself has a big impact on its performance. A deep curve allows for lifting the puck easier while a shallow curve allows for easier backhand shots.

  <h2>Shot</h2>
  <h3>Types of shots</h3>
  <dl class="a">
    <dt>Shovel</dt>
    <dd>The shovel shot is the simplest and most basic shot in a shooter's arsenal. Its execution is simply a shoveling motion to push the puck in the desired direction</dd><br>

    <dt>Wrist</dt>
    <dd>he wrist shot is executed by positioning the puck toward the heel-middle of the blade. From that position the shooter rolls his back wrist quickly, while thrusting the puck forward with the bottom hand. As the blade propels the puck forward the movement of the wrist rolls the puck toward the end of the blade, causing the puck to spin</dd><br>

    <dt>Slapshot</dt>
    <dd>The slapshot is the hardest, yet most telegraphed, shot. The player draws their stick back away from the puck, then forcefully brings it forward to strike the ice just behind the puck. This causes energy to be stored in the stick as it flexes against the ice. When the stick finally contacts the puck, the energy stored in the stick is transferred to the puck, providing additional force that would not otherwise be possible by hitting the puck directly. </dd><br>

    <dt>Snap</dt>
    <dd>The snap shot is a combination of both the slap-shot and the wrist shot. The shooter begins by cocking the stick back like a slap-shot, and finishes with a flicking of the wrist like a wrist shot. </dd><br>

    <dt>Backhand</dt>
    <dd>The backhand shot is a wrist shot released from the back of the blade, and on the player's backhand. This shot is not as powerful or accurate as any of the other shots, but often comes unexpectedly.</dd><br>
