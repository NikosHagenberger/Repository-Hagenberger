**Project Proposal**

**About us**

We, Stefan Oswald (16) and Nikos Hagenberger (16) are two students of the HTBLA Leonding. We are currently in second grade and very interested in programming. In the subject    "WEBT ", we got the exercise, to make a website. Of course, this is a big task, but we also have a lot of time for it. The time period for it is the whole second grade, which means from 9.9 - 11.7. 

**The Project Approach Summary**

Our two-man team is very organized. We use mediums like GitHub, Discord etc. so we can stay in contact and can easily transfer the files. We use the programming languages:
•	CSS
•	JavaScript
•	The markdown language "HTML", for the "skeleton" of the website
We also have the knowledge in C, C++ and C#.
If we notice something, we don't like, we directly change this. So, our website is every time updated. 









**Project Summary**

The main goal of our website is to tell the readers something about different types of sport. We describe six various types: Basketball, Ice Hockey, Skiing, Soccer and Swimming. About this sport we write something like rules of sports, the stuff you need to do it, how it works, championships, player and so on.
We also have an index chapter on our website where you find information about ourselves and also contact information to contact us.
We want to make a login system, so every user can sign up. On every single type of sports, there is a little quiz at the end. You can learn about the sport type and then do the quiz. So, if you get a good result (9/10 points or something like that) you get ranked in a list. Every user can see, who is the best “reader”.
We started doing this project about sport because we love sport and its very import for your body. A second reason is that we hope that we can motivate some people to start doing sport.
At the beginning we started to design a website with HTML, then we learned something about CSS. Now in the second semester we also use JavaScript the create a better web application. Later we also will work with a webserver where we can save data from the quiz.
With our website, we want to get the people to sport. It is very healthy and everyone should do it!


**Project Risk Management**

We don't have that much risks. A Risk would be for example, that the quality of our website will be bad. Or that we will get sick, which is at the current time not very unlikely. In a professional team, there are more risks. For example, that they can't handle the costs etc. 


**Project Costs**

Luckily, we do not have any costs. We make this project in school and school is in Austria free. 


**Conclusion**

I think that we have a very good structured plan and we will master it greatly. I also hope that the result of our website will be good, so the users of it can enjoy it.
