  <h1>Skiing</h1>
  <p>
    Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the pastime of sliding down snow-covered slopes on skis. Whether for recreation or for sport, it is typically practised at ski resorts, which provide such services as ski lifts, artificial snow making, snow grooming, restaurants, and ski patrol. "Off-piste" skiers—those skiing outside ski area boundaries—may employ snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats to deliver them to the top of a slope.
    <br>Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936. A skier following the fall line will reach the maximum possible speed for that slope.
  </p>

  <h2>Technique</h2>
  <p>
    downhill skiing technique focuses on the use of turns to smoothly turn the skis from one direction to another. Additionally, the skier can use the same techniques to turn the ski away from the direction of movement, generating skidding forces between the skis and snow which further slow the descent.
  </p>

  <h3>Carving</h3>
  Carving is based on the shape of the ski itself; when the ski is rotated onto its edge, the pattern cut into its side causes it to bend into an arc. The contact between the arc of the ski edges and the snow naturally causes the ski to tend to move along that arc, changing the skiers direction of motion.

  <h2>Equipment</h2>
  <h3>Skies</h3>
    Modern alpine skis are shaped to enable carve turning, and have evolved significantly since the 1980s, with variants such as powder skis, freestyle skis, all-mountain skis, kid's skis and more. All-mountain skis are the most common type of ski, and tend to be used as a typical alpine ski. All-mountain skis are built to do a little bit of everything; they can be used in fresh snow or used when skiing groomed runs.

  <h3>Boots</h3>
  Ski boots are one of the most important accessories to skiing. They connect the skier to the skis, allowing them full control over the ski. When ski boots first came about they were made of leather and laces were used. The leather ski boots started off as low cut, but gradually became taller as injuries became more common allowing for more ankle support.

  <h3>Helmet</h3>
  The purpose of ski helmets are to reduce the chances of getting a head injury while skiing. Helmets are available in many styles, and typically consist of a hard plastic/resin shell with inner padding. Modern ski helmets may include many additional features such as vents, earmuffs, headphones, goggle mounts, and camera mounts.


  <h2>Competition</h2>
  <p>
    Elite competitive skiers participate in the FIS World Cup, the World Championships, and the Winter Olympics. Broadly speaking, competitive skiing in racing is divided into a few disciplines:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Slalom</dt>
    <dd>In the alpine skiing discipline you have to ski between poles or gates. These are spaced more closely than those in giant slalom, super giant slalom and downhill, necessitating quicker and shorter turns. Internationally.</dd><br>

    <dt>Giant slalom</dt>
    <dd>This discipline involves skiing between sets of poles (gates) spaced at a greater distance from each other than in slalom but less than in Super-G. Giant slalom and slalom make up the technical events in alpine ski racing. This category separates them from the speed events of Super-G and downhill. The technical events are normally composed of two runs, held on different courses on the same ski run.</dd><br>

    <dt>Super-G</dt>
    <dd>Much like downhill, a super-G course consists of widely set gates that racers must pass through. The course is set so that skiers must turn more than in downhill, though the speeds are still much higher than in giant slalom. Each athlete only has one run to clock the best time. In the Olympics, super-G courses are usually set on the same slopes as the downhill, but with a lower starting point.</dd><br>

    <dt>Downhill</dt>
    <dd>Downhill is a form of alpine skiing competition. Whereas the other alpine skiing events (slalom, giant slalom, super giant slalom, and combined) emphasize turning and technique, downhill emphasizes "the six components of technique, courage, speed, risk, physical condition and judgement". Speeds of up to 130 km/h are common in international competition. Athletes must have an aerodynamically efficient tuck position to minimize drag and increase speed.[</dd><br>

  <h3>FIS Alpine Ski World Cup</h3>
  <p>
    The FIS Alpine Ski World Cup is the top international circuit of alpine skiing competitions, launched in 1966 by a group of ski racing friends. The first World Cup ski race was held in Berchtesgaden, West Germany, on January 5, 1967. Jean-Claude Killy of France and Nancy Greene of Canada were the overall winners for the first two seasons.
    <br>The most successful country is by far Austria.The most successful skiers are the Austrians Marcel Hirscher and Annemarie Moser-Pröll.
  </p>

  <h3>Winter Olympics</h3>
  <p>Alpine skiing has been contested at every Winter Olympics since 1936.The event is traditional dominated by Alpine countries, Austria has a commanding lead in total medals with 121 and in gold medals with 37.</p>
