  <h1>Soccer</h1>

  <div class="clear">
    <br>
    <p>Soccer, is a team sport played with a spherical ball between two teams of eleven players. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal.</p>

  <h2>Gameplay</h2>

  <p>
    Soccer is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The game is played using a spherical ball, known as the football. Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a throw-in restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around they may use any part of their body other than their hands or arms. Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though players may not pass to teammates who are in an offside position.

  <h2>Laws<h2>
  <h3>Duration and tie-breaking methods</h3>
  <h4>90-minute ordinary time</h4>

  <p>
    A standard adult football match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while lost time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is out of play, and a 90-minute game typically involves about an hour of "effective playing time". The referee alone signals the end of the match.
  </p>

  <h4>Tie-breaking</h4>

<p>
    In league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock; some competitions may invoke replays. A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of penalty shootouts to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament.

<h3>Ball in and out of play</h3>

Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ball in play and ball out of play. From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:

<dl class="a">
  <dt>Kick-off</dt>
  <dd>-following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play.</dd><br>

  <dt>Throw-in</dt>
  <dd>-when the ball has crossed the touchline; awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball.</dd><br>

  <dt>Goal kick</dt>
  <dd>-when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the attacking team; awarded to defending team.</dd><br>

  <dt>Corner kick</dt>
  <dd>when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the defending team; awarded to attacking team.</dd><br>

  <dt>Indirect free kick</dt>
  <dd>-awarded to the opposing team following "non-penal" fouls, certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution or dismiss an opponent without a specific foul having occurred. A goal may not be scored directly from an indirect free kick.</dd><br>

  <dt>Direct free kick</dt>
  <dd>awarded to fouled team following certain listed "penal" fouls. A goal may be scored directly from a direct free kick.</dd><br>

  <dt>Penalty kick</dt>
  <dd>awarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area.</dd><br>

  <dt>Dropped-ball</dt>
  <dd>occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason, such as a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective.</dd><br>

<h2>Competitions<h2>

<h3>World Cup</h3>
  <p>
      The largest and most important competition is the World Cup, organised by FIFA. The competition takes place every four years since 1930 with the exeption of two times during the 2nd World War.
      Around 200 national teams compete for a place in the World Cup in qualifying tournaments in continental competitions.
      The World Cup involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period.<br>
      There is also a World Cup for women. The FIFA Women's World Cup, which has been held since 1991, also every four years.
  </p>

<h3>Olympic Games</h3>

  <p>
      There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900.
      Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics were the most prestigious international football event. According to an agreement with FIFA, no professional players are allowed to play there.
      So it's kind of an amateur competition<br>
  </p>

<h3>Club football</h3>
  The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores in South America.
