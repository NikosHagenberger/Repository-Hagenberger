 <h1>Swimming</h1>

 Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water. The sport takes place in pools or open water. Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports, with varied distance events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley.

<h2>Competitive swimming</h2>
<p>
  Competitive swimming became popular in the 19th century. The goal of high level competitive swimming is to break personal or world records while beating competitors in any given event. Swimming in competition should create the least resistance in order to obtain maximum speed. Swimming is an event at the Summer Olympic Games, where male and female athletes compete in 16 of the recognized events each. Olympic events are held in a 50-meter pool, called a long course pool.

<h3>Swim styles</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>Butterfly</dt>
  <dd>The butterfly is a swimming style swum on the chest, with both arms moving symmetrically. While other styles can be swum by beginners, the butterfly is a more difficult stroke that requires good technique as well as strong muscles. It is the newest swimming style swum in competition, first swum in 1933.</dd><br>

  <dt>Backstroke</dt>
  <dd>Backstroke or back crawl is the only one of the competetive styles swum on the back. This swimming style has the advantage of easy breathing, but the disadvantage of swimmers not being able to see where they are going. It also has a different start from the other three competition swimming styles. In backstroke, the arms contribute most of the forward movement. The arms alternate so that always one arm is underwater while the other arm is recovering.</dd><br>

  <dt>Breaststroke</dt>
  <dd>Breaststroke is a swimming style in which the swimmer is on their chest and the torso does not rotate. It is the most popular recreational style due to the swimmer's head being out of the water a large portion of the time, and that it can be swum comfortably at slow speeds.  However, at the competitive level, swimming breaststroke at speed requires comparable endurance and strength to other styles. Some people refer to breaststroke as the "frog" style, as the arms and legs move somewhat like a frog swimming in the water. The style itself is the slowest of any competitive styles and is thought to be the oldest of all swimming styles.</dd><br>

  <dt>Freestyle</dt>
  <dd>Freestyle races are the most common of all swimming competitions, with distances beginning with 50 meters and reaching 1500 meters. The term 'freestyle' is sometimes used as a synonym for 'front crawl', as front crawl is the fastest swimming stroke. It is now the most common stroke used in freestyle competitions. During a race, the competitor circles the arms forward in alternation, kicking the feet up and down </dd><br>

This race is either swum by one swimmer as individual medley (IM) or by four swimmers as a medley relay.Individual medley consists of four strokes.

</ol>
