  <h1>Tennis</h1>

  Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return.
  The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.

  <h2>Equipment</h2>

  <h3>Rackets</h3>
  <p>
    The components of a tennis racket include a handle, known as the grip, connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds a matrix of tightly pulled strings. For the first 100 years of the modern game, rackets were made of wood and of standard size, and strings were of animal gut.
    Rackets made of metal and then composite materials made of carbon graphite, ceramic and lighter metals such as titanium have been used since the 20th century.These stronger materials made it possible to produce oversized clubs that gave even more performance. In the meantime, due to the technology, synthetic strings with a longer durability have been used.

  <h3>Tennis balls</h3>
  <p>
    Tennis balls were originally made of cloth strips stitched together with thread and stuffed with feathers. Modern tennis balls are made of hollow vulcanized rubber with a felt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant colour was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to allow for improved visibility.
    Tennis balls were traditionally manufactured in the United States and Europe. Although the process of producing the balls has remained virtually unchanged for the past 100 years, the majority of manufacturing now takes place in the Far East. The relocation is due to cheaper labour costs and materials in the region.

  <h2>Scoring</h2>
  <h3>Game</h3>
  <p>
    A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent.
    The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from one to three points are described as  "15", "30", and "40", respectively. If at least three points have been scored by each player, making the player's scores equal at 40 apiece, the score is not called out as "40–40", but rather as "deuce".
    If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is "advantage" for the player in the lead. If the player who has the advantage also wins the next point, the game goes to him. If, however, his opponent succeeds in deciding the point for himself, the score is again deuce. It is then played until a player who has advantage also scores the next point
  </p>

  <h3>Set</h3>
  <p>
    A set consists of a sequence of games played with service alternating between games, ending when the count of games won meets certain criteria. Typically, a player wins a set by winning at least six games and at least two games more than the opponent. If one player has won six games and the opponent five, an additional game is played. If the leading player wins that game, the player wins the set 7–5. If the trailing player wins the game (tying the set 6–6) a tie-break is played.
    A tie-break, played under a separate set of rules, allows one player to win one more game and thus the set, to give a final set score of 7–6.
  </p>

  <h3>Match</h3>
  <p>
    A match consists of a sequence of sets. The outcome is determined through a best of three or five sets system. The first player to win two sets in a best-of-three, or three sets in a best-of-five, wins the match.

  <h2>Shots</h2>
  A competent tennis player has eight basic shots in his or her repertoire: the serve, forehand, backhand, volley, half-volley, overhead smash, drop shot, and lob.

    <dl class="a">
      <dt>Serve</dt>
      <dd>A serve (short form for service) in tennis is a shot to start a game. The serve is initiated by throwing the ball into the air and hitting it into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net. When a player misses a shot he has a second try. If the ball hits the net on the first serve and bounces over into the correct diagonal box then it is called a "let" and the server gets two more additional serves to get it in.</dd><br>

      <dt>Forehand</dt>
      <dd>For a right-handed player, the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of the body. </dd><br>

      <dt>Backhand</dt>
      <dd>For right-handed players, the backhand is a stroke that begins on the left side of their body, continues across their body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the right side of their body. It can be executed with either one hand or with both and is generally considered more difficult to master than the forehand. </dd><br>
    </dl>

    <h2>Tournaments</h2>

    <h3>Grand Slam</h3>
    <p>
      The four Grand Slam tournaments are considered to be the most prestigious tennis events in the world. They are held annually and comprise the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. Each tournament is played over a two-week period. Wimbledon is the oldest, founded in 1877, followed by the US in 1881, the French in 1891, and the Australian in 1905.
      However the French Championships was not considered a major before 1924–25, when all four became designated Grand Slam tournaments.
